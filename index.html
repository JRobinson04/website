                    <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking powered</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Directions:</p>
                    <p>
                        1.	Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a heavy skillet or deep fryer
                        2.	Beat milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture until smooth.
                        3.	Use your finger to cover the funnel hole; pour about 1 cup of batter into the funnel. Starting in the center of the skillet, remove your finger and move the funnel in a swirling motion to make a 6- or 7-inch round. Fry in hot oil until bottom is golden brown; flip and continue cooking until golden brown all over, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels. Continue cooking remaining batter. 
                        4.	Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve warm.
                        Funnel cakes are best fresh but can be kept in refrigerator for 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Reheat then cover with powdered sugar.
